You are red. Eat all the others. Click to create new cell within your body. Hold to expand it. You spawn on the left. Do not get eaten yourself. The bigger the window, the better.

Originally meant to be an area capture strategy game, it turned into an odd arcade-style game instead. Click within your area to create a new cell - depicted by a square. Click and hold on the cell to expand it. There is a maximum size. Eat the others by running into their cells and absorbing them.

There is no explicit win/lose.. if you are entirely eaten, you can no longer create a new cell. And if you do eat all the others, there's nothing left to do but refresh to try again!

Almost mesmerising enough in itself just to watch the (bad) AI move about.
